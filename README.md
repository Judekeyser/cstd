# cstd
My own C standard library

- characters processing:
    - base64 facility
    - unicode normalisation facility
    - string formatting (templating)
- data structures:
    - tree structure
    - linked list/vector
    - ring buffer
- format
    - json
    - url parsing
- numeric
    - proper interface for signed integers with overflow handling
    - bigint
    - bigdecimal
- date
    - UTC date ease
    - easy to make timezone aware things
- assertions
    - I'd like to assert an entire block
    - I'd like to have formatted messages (likely a combine of assert and printf)
